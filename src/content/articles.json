When the body is stuck in that high-alert pattern, thought loops, physical tension, and sleep disruption follow. Meditation shifts this pattern by strengthening the parasympathetic response—the natural calming system—and by training attention so your mind spends less time fueling the worry loop. Clinical research shows measurable reductions in anxiety symptoms when people practice evidence-based programs like MBSR regularly."

Slow, deliberate breathing activates the vagus nerve and the parasympathetic system, triggering a predictable cascade of calming effects: lower heart rate, reduced blood pressure, decreased cortisol, and improved heart rate variability (HRV).

Research published in the Journal of Pain tracked MBSR participants for 15 months post-program, finding that benefits not only persisted but continued improving in those who maintained regular practice. This suggests meditation builds cumulative pain-management skills rather than providing temporary relief."

This is normal—you're becoming more attuned to sensations previously suppressed through distraction. Research shows this initial intensification typically decreases within 1-2 weeks as you develop skills in non-reactive observation. If pain becomes overwhelming, shorten sessions or practice movement-based meditation instead."
