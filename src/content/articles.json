While some experience immediate calm, many don't notice changes for 2-3 weeks. Brain imaging studies show structural changes occur even when practitioners don't report subjective differences. Trust the process and focus on consistency rather than immediate results. Track your practice to identify subtle improvements in stress reactivity, emotional balance, or focus that emerge over time."
